# autodiff Implementation of an automated differentiation system using generalized dual numbers (i.e. truncated Taylor expansions). The underlying truncated polynomial algebra (differential algebra) is dealt with using [Piranha](https://github.com/bluescarni/piranha) and can deal with high orders and many variables. The polynomial multiplication algorithm used in piranha (original with the software author [Francesco Biscani](https://github.com/bluescarni)) takes advantage of sparsity, multiple-threads and cache efficiency.  This library was developed with the goal to extend the capabilities of [existing automated differentiation libraries](http://www.autodiff.org/?module=Tools) allowing high order differentiation in many variables in a straight forward way to the user.
